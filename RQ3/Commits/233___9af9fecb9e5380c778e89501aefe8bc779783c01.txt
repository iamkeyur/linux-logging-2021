    scsi: ncr5380: Suppress unhelpful "interrupt without IRQ bit" message
    
    If a NCR5380 host instance ends up on a shared interrupt line then
    this printk will be a problem. It is already a problem on some Mac
    models: when testing mac_scsi on a PowerBook 180 I found that PDMA
    transfers (but not PIO transfers) cause the message to be logged.
    
    These spurious interrupts don't appear to come from the DRQ signal from
    the 5380. And they don't happen at all on the Mac LC III. A comment in
    the NetBSD source code mentions this mystery. Testing seems to show
    that we can safely ignore these interrupts.
