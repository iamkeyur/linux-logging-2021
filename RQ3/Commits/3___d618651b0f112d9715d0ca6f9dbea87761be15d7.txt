    thinkpad_acpi: Don't yell on unsupported brightness interfaces
    
    The thinkpad_acpi driver currently emits error messages on unsupported
    brightness interfaces, giving the impression that someone will implement
    those. However, this error is spit out on nearly every thinkpad in
    production since 2 years now. Furthermore, the backlight interfaces on
    those devices are supported by the i915 driver just fine.
    
    Downgrade the error message to a normal pr_info() and stop telling people
    to report it to IBM.
