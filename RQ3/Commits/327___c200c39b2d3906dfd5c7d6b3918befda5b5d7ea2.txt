    clk: clk-conf: Fix error message when clock isn't found
    
    When failing to lookup the assigned clock for setting its parents, we
    were previously printing a misleading error message that lead to think
    that it was the parent clock what couldn't be found.
    
    Change error message to make clear that it's the assigned clock what
    couldn't be found in this case.
