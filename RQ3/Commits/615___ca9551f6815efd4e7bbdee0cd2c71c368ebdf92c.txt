    greybus: timesync: Printout strobe count on sync failure
    
    If we failed to synchronize the FrameTime it would be useful to know how
    many of the expected strobes arrived, for example a value of 0/5 would
    indicate the SVC was completely dead but a value of 4/5 would indicate one
    GPIO pulse got lost i.e. the AP was too slow reacting to an interrupt and
    completely missed one of the strobe events. In either case the actual
    number of strobes is a useful thing to print out.
