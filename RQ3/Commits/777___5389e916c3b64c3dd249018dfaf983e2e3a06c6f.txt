    drm/i915: Spell vga_switcheroo consistently
    
    Currently everyone and their dog has their own favourite spelling
    for vga_switcheroo. This makes it hard to grep dmesg for log entries
    relating to vga_switcheroo. It also makes it hard to find related
    source files in the tree.
    
    vga_switcheroo.c uses pr_fmt "vga_switcheroo". Use that everywhere.
