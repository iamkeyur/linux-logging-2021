    staging: greybus: log: Fix line over 80 characters.
    
    Fix coding style issue caught by checkpatch.pl related to the following
    warning:
            - CHECK: WARNING: line over 80 characters
    This is done by dropping a redundant cast and by replacing the format specifier
    in dev_err(); to "%zu" instead of "%d", in order to silence the warnings of the
    compiler.
    
    Also, while at it, drop the redundant cast in the comparison as well to maintain
    consistency.
