    scsi: core: use scmd_printk() to print which command timed out
    
    With a possibly faulty disk the following messages may appear in the logs:
    
    kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 180s
    kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 20s
    kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 20s
    kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 60s
    kernel: sd 0:0:9:0: timing out command, waited 20s
    
    This is not very informative because it's not possible to identify the
    command that timed out.
    
    This patch replaces sdev_printk() with scmd_printk().
